# Cardinal Direction Accuracy Tester

The Direction and Distance Accuracy Tester is a Python project that allows you to see how accurate an approximation of a friend's location can be when you only know their distance and cardinal direction from your own location. Developed in VSCode.

The project takes in the coordinates of your location and your friend's location on a 2D grid. Then performs trigonometric calculations and basic linear algebra to estimate the position of your friend on the grid based on the given data. A plot is then generated to show how accurate the estimate is, by displaying the actual position of your friend, your estimated position of your friend, and the distance between the two.

This project can be helpful in demonstrating the limitations of using cardinal directions and distances to approximate the location of a friend (or anything else) that can be given in a talkable languaje, and the importance of having more precise location data to ensure accuracy. It can also be used to showcase the application of trigonometry and linear algebra in real-world scenarios.
